    <h2>Steps for making stuffed-pepper</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes until rice is tender.</li>
        <li>In a skillet over medium heat, heat oil, add ground beef, and cook until evenly browned and crumbly (7 to 9 minutes).</li>
        <li>Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms if needed to make them stand up straight.</li>
        <li>Arrange the peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.</li>
        <li>Prepare the filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon equal amounts of filling into each hollowed pepper.</li>
        <li>Mix the remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, then pour it over the stuffed peppers.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until the peppers are tender (about 1 hour).</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
